name: Personal Website
description: This website serves as a personal platform for me to share my insights through blog posts and showcase my portfolio of projects. It's built using Next.js, a React framework with built-in features, such as file-based routing, data fetching, optimizations. This website leverage React Server Components, a new React's feature which gives better performance by rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client. This website also uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for greater customizability and provides a better developer experience for styling my elements. This is an ongoing project with no specific end date. I see it as a canvas to experiment with new technologies, design concepts, and content strategies. As I continue to evolve and grow, so will this website.
