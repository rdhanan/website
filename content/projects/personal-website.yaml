name: Personal Website
description: The website that you're currently on, serves as a personal platform for sharing what I've learned through blog posts and showcasing my project portfolio. It's built using Next.js, a React framework that offers features like file-based routing, data fetching, and various optimizations. This project utilizes React Server Components, a recent addition to React's capabilities. Additionally, Tailwind CSS, a versatile CSS framework is used, enabling greater customization and maintainability. I view this project as a canvas to experiment with new technologies, design concepts, and content strategies. As I continue to evolve and grow, so will this website.
