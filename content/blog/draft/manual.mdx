# Environment-specific conditions

Features that are only run in Vercel production environment:

- Umami analytics
- `getLastModified()` function
- `generateRSS()` function
- `increment()` function

# Environment Variables

- Check `./src/env.js` for list of required environment variables.
- Insufficient environment variables will cause the build to fail.

# Draft

To mark a post as draft, place the content inside `./content/blog/draft` folder. It will have the following characteristics:

- Will not be included in the RSS feed, sitemap, and post list (unless `PostList` component is called with `draft: true` prop).
- Will have a **Draft** badge above the post title.
- Will not display views.
- Will have robots meta tag set to `noindex`. (This includes the post page and the post list page.)

To view all drafts, go to `/drafts` page. In development environment, a Drafts menu will appear in top navigation bar.
